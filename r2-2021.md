## Log

#### D1: 07-03 Making webpages with React. Things work differently compared to HTMl/JS e.g. forms = controlled components. Testing psql (postgres) and creating databases.
#### D2: 07-04 Working on React again: - Movie list (DM) rewrite. Opened a pull request on [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) to amend the readme file (for the npx command).
#### D3: 07-05 Downloaded [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/); went through Express.js today (DM). Using Postgres with Node and Express.js.
#### D4: 07-06 Worked on more backend today using Express to set up API endpoints. Injected a git shortcut into my bash profile on Mac.
#### D5: 07-07 Learned about APIs (application programming interfaces) today (DM). Testing out Pokeapi and PUT/POST/DELETE requests using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), https://app.swaggerhub.com/search, & https://joes-autos.herokuapp.com/api/vehicles.
#### D6: 07-08 Learned about cryptography and security. Using [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs).
#### D7: 07-09 Worked on a backend assessment today. Utilized Node.js [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module to write into a .json file locally.
#### D8: 07-10 Did a little styling on the [portfolio website](https://adnjoo.com/) and the [movie app](https://github.com/adnjoo/my-movie-app). Used the following helpful CSS properties: transition: transform, and  transform: scale().
#### D9: 07-11 Added create + delete functionality to [my-movie-app](https://github.com/adnjoo/my-movie-app/) using Axios and Express. Fixed a git commit message after push [with some help](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-change-a-git-commit-message-after-a-push)
#### D10: 07-12 Learning about QA today. Learned about [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) software for project management / issue tracking. Worked on movie app functionality.
#### D11: 07-13 learned more about QA today including the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) library to test functions. We use describe to group tests together. Took a little break today from coding. Felt like I needed a quick breather.
#### D12: 07-14 learned and used Automation today with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html) including xpath to find and automate tests. Opened a pull request for a minor edit in the readme on a DevMtn [repo](https://github.com/DevMountain-QA/wanted-queries).
#### D13: 07-15 trying [Angular](https://angular.io/) out. learning deployment today at DM. Pushed local postgres DB into heroku using the heroku pg:push ... command.
#### D14: 07-16 assessment at DM today covering the week's topics: i.e. testing, QA, and deployment. Outcomes lecture - importsnce of a good resume. Debugged the movie app back end. Apparently using a hard coded port = 4001 instead of process.env.PORT was causing the app to hang. Fixed!
#### D15: 07-17 Added some more functionality to my movie app. Used setState on a k:v pair in an object in an array when I'm fetching movie posters from TMDB. I also re-routed my Exercise Tracker app from Heroku to GH-pages using Hashrouter, to free up more space on my free Heroku. Well I made [this fun Swedish House Mafia website](https://adnjoo.github.io/swedish-house/) lmao.
#### D16: 07-18 Self-care day today. Going on a hike later. Implemented tailwind in the movie app. I really like tailwind.
#### D17: 07-19 Learned about DevOps+CI/CD today and wrote a YAML configuration file for a node app to be used in circleci. Worked on [weather app](https://github.com/adnjoo/weather-app) today - writing with React and Tailwind.
#### D18: 07-20 implemented toggle button by using react-switch in weather app.
