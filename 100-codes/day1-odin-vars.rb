#assignment 1: read variables chapter https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables
# gets to get string
# name = gets.chomp
# .chomp to remove carriage return characters at end
# puts name
# variable scope determines where in a program a var is avail to use
# block {} || do/end

end

puts a       # is it accessible here?
# yes because for... do/end did not create a new inner scope

5 types of variables:
constants,
global variables,
class variables,
instance variables,
and local variables

#global variables are used everywhere

#ex5 quiz
#1st prints 3
#2nd prints error because x is local scope var

# assignment 2: rubymonstas
# name = thing
# var = 10

# assignment 3: repl.it - ok

#additional rsrcs - bastard ok; in ruby vars are referred to as pointers and references

#vars as pointers -> not done
